        <h1>Welcome to Positronikal on GitHub!</h1>
            <p>
                Positronikal is the moniker I've used for several years for my digital projects. The majority of projects I intend to park here pertain to digital forensics and cyber investigation. That said, there will likely also be projects that don't directly pertain to these subject matter areas. I'll eventually move these back to my personal account at <a href="https://github.com/hoyt-harness">https://github.com/hoyt-harness</a>. The main projects I'm waiting on here pertain to the <cite>Carnivore Digital Forensic System</cite>, but there may be others. Other projects I follow, contribute to, and/or make use of some way appear as forks in my personal repositories linked above.
            </p>

                <blockquote>
                    This is just as the name implies - a simple backup utility for GNU/Linux. It's written in bash and makes use of rsync and dialog. rsync is a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file copying tool. dialog displays dialog boxes from shell scripts. There is plenty of room to expand this project, add new dialog boxes, and make much more of rsync's capabilities. I've taken it as far as I care to, but I welcome other interested contributors. See the section below titled <cite>Contributing</cite>.

                <blockquote>
                    BugZapper is a bash debugger utility written in bash and inspired by <cite>Learning the bash shell</cite> by Cameron Newham and Bill Rosenblatt (O'Reilly, 2005). I highly suggest obtaining a copy of the reference book and getting comfortable with the material it contains before attempting to contribute to this project. The book's authors highlight other ways this utility can be extended. Those pull requests or any others seeking to improve it are welcome. See the section below titled <cite>Contributing</cite>.
